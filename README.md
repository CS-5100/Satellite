# Satellite Coverage Analysis

The repository contains a set of tools aimed at optimizing the placing of the Starlink constellation in order to achieve maximum area coverage. Using Two-Line Element data, geographic transformations, and spatial data processing, the project analyzes and optimizes the unique area covered by the satellite network.

## Project Overview

The SpaceX Starlink network is currently the most extensive and technologically advanced satellite constellation in low earth orbit, offering high-speed, low-latency broadband internet worldwide. This work focuses on improving the performance of Starlink by solving the optimization problem of satellite positioning to achieve maximum area coverage.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have Python installed, along with the required packages outlined in the `requirements.txt` file. The repository is set up to handle TLE data, calculate satellite coverage, and assess spatial overlap.

## Features

1. **TLE Download and Conversion**: Download TLE data for satellite constellations, such as Starlink, directly from CelesTrak and convert it into a structured pandas DataFrame.
2. **Satellite Position Calculation**: Calculate real-time latitude, longitude, and altitude of satellites using TLE data.
3. **Coverage Area Calculation**: 
   - **Total Coverage Area**: Computes coverage radius and area based on latitude, longitude, and altitude.
   - **Unique Coverage Area**: Uses BallTree spatial indexing to determine overlapping satellites, calculating the union of all coverage areas to avoid double-counting.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    cd /your/preferred/location/
    git clone https://github.com/CS-5100/Satellite.git
    cd Satellite/
    ```
    > **Note**: GitHub has removed [password-based authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls) when cloning with HTTPS URLs. Instead, use **GitHub CLI** or **personal access tokens (PAT)** for authentication when prompted.

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   **Note:** The repository requires external libraries, including:
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `requests`
   - `pyorbital`
   - `shapely`
   - `geopandas`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `networkx`

## Usage

### Download and Process TLE Data

To download the latest TLE data and store it in a DataFrame:

```python
from tle_processing import download_tle_data_to_dataframe

url = "https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/supplemental/sup-gp.php?FILE=starlink&FORMAT=tle"
df = download_tle_data_to_dataframe(url)
print(df.head())
```

### Calculate Inter-Satellite Distance

Given two satellite positions, the calculate distance script calculates the Cartesian (Euclidean) distance between two satellites in Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinates.

```python
from satellite_distance import calculate_distance

# Example positions in Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude format
position1 = (550, 53, 0)    # Satellite 1's position
position2 = (540, 50, 20)   # Satellite 2's position

# Calculate the distance between two satellites
distance = calculate_distance(position1, position2)
```

### Compute Unique Coverage Area

To calculate the unique coverage area:

```python
from calculateUniqueCA_NEW import calculate_unique_coverage_area

# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame with columns: 'Satellite Name', 'Latitude', 'Longitude', and 'Coverage Area (km^2)'
unique_coverage_area = calculate_unique_coverage_area(df)
print(f"Total unique coverage area: {unique_coverage_area} kmÂ²")
```

This function uses BallTree spatial indexing to compute unique coverage areas by grouping overlapping satellites and calculating the union of their coverage areas.
