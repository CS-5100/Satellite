Made a list of what we'd need to do for the particle swarm optimization - Aniket
 
Code deliverables:
-function to compute total unique area coverage
-fitness function that uses the above area coverage function 
-function that, given a list of all of the satellites, checks if ALL satellites meet distance constraints (10km to 100 km)
-function to calculate intersatellite distance
-figure out how to define each satellite as a "particle" for the model  (defining a "position" and "velocity" of each particle which ARE SEPARATE meanings and not physics related) 
 
 
Once those are complete, we do:
-The main Particle Swarm Optimization loop
 

Even if we do not move forward with PSO, some of these functions will be helpful regardless for local search in general
