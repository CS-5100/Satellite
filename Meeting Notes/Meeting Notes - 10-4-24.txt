Meeting Notes - 10/4/24
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- To calculate the surface area cover, we use an estimation of a Ka-band transmitter with a half-power beamwidth of 45 degrees; this is common amongst many commercial providers
-We use this angle and a specific satellite's altitude to calculate the radius of a cone, and generate surface area based on the circle on the bottom face of the cone.
-Specific formula used: 
- area = pi * (altitude * tan(45 degrees / 2))^2
-Dan provided us a visualization of the satellites locations based on the positions we calculated yesterday. 
-Gil proposed Montecarlo dot placement to find overlaps
-Akhilesh mentioned Haversine formula

Next Steps:
- We would need a way to visualize the surface area coverage of each satellite in the representation Dan gave us. 
- We need a method to find overlaps in surface area coverage 
- We need to find a way to map this ^^^^ found area to "land" or "ocean"
- Total area covered - overlaps would be a great scoring function

Aside:
- We could also keep intersatellite distance in mind as a scoring function as well. -Aniket
- Maximize for the largest intersatellite distance possible
