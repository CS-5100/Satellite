Came up with an idea to help minimize computation of distance constraint: -Aniket

-We implement zone-based coverage above Earth such that we make equally space large spheres (3D) around Earth with a pre-determined radius; let's say 50 km for now
-If all of these zones have at least one satellite, we know that all satellites regardless of placement will be able to communicate with the rest of the network
-Only computation that would be left is when we place satellites to ensure they aren't immediately within 10km of any existing craft.
