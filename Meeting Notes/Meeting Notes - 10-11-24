Made a sample PSO loop for when we finish all of the helper functions. - Aniket

Additionally, I have an idea to save computation on distances:
-We implement zone-based coverage above Earth such that we make large spheres (3D) around Earth
-and if all of these zones have at least one satellite, we know that the distance criteria is met. 

-Only computation then left is when we place satellites to ensure they aren't immediately within 10km of any existing craft.
