Meeting Notes:

-We finally have representation of land and ocean coverage (thanks Gil!)
-Rest of the group should look to understand GeoPandas
-We should implement geopandas_test.py as a function so we can use it for the objective function. 
-Any population maps would be very helpful. 



For the model:
-We first process TLEs
-Then we determine land/ocean/pop./general coverage
-This is sent to the objective function/model to handle and make decision based on generated data 
-Only then can we reprocess TLEs



-Aniket and Akhilesh:
-Make the local search model based on the total coverage parameter Gil/Dan made

-Gil and Dan:
-Refined area covered by satellites
-Land vs ocean

-Anubhab:
-Perhaps find population data map
